# EHMI Delivery Status IG

The EHMI Delivery Status (EDS) Implementation Guide is a Content Profile that defines some basic and reusable logging patterns based on the FHIR AuditEvent Resource, that is used between an EDS device client and the EDS server. 
EDS is based upon and inspired by IHE Basic Audit Log Patterns (IHE BALP) Implementation Guide, which is a Content Profile that defines some basic and reusable AuditEvent patterns. 

A focus is on enabling Privacy centric AuditEvent logs that hold well-formed indication of message communication around a Patient, when they are the subject of messaging being recorded on the EHMI Delivery Status Server.
